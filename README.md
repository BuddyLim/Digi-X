The solution for: 

Section 1:

Front-end/Back-end: PHP
DBMS: MySQL 

The reason why I chose PHP is because PHP is multi-platform while being compatible with most servers used today and it can connect to many databases. For front-end side of PHP perhaps a GUI extension can be used to provide an user interface. 
For database management, the reason why I chose MySQL is because it is available for free and it can be made to work with DB2 and Oracle DBMS if need be.
